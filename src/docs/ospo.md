The Open Source Program Office looks after Wayfair's communities and ecosystem around open source, as well as the standards, policies, and operations required to maintain, create, and contribute to open source projects.

These efforts are broadly grouped into three pillars:

- [Advocacy](/docs/ospo/advocacy)
- [Auxiliary Engineering](/docs/ospo/aux-eng)
- [Platform](/docs/ospo/platform)
